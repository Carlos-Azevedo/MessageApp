# MessageApp
Messaging app for evaluation

# How to Run
Simply build the solution and execute MessageApp.exe from the MessageApp project output.

To quit the project simply type 'exit'.

Exit is not a supported user name!

# Commands

The App expects an input of type <userName> <command> [Argument].

<userName> : This argument is case insensitive. A new user is created when their first message is posted.

<command> : Accepts '->', 'wall', 'follow' and blank.

Use -> to post a message from [Argument]

Use wall to retrieve all your user's messages and messages for followed users.

Use follows to begin following another User. If the user does not exist nothing happens.

Use just the user name to retrieve all their messages.
